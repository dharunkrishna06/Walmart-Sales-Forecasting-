# Walmart Sales Forecasting & ROI Insights

![Project Overview](https://github.com/dharunkrishna06/Walmart-Sales-Forecasting-/blob/main/Others/Walmart.jpg)

This project presents a sales forecasting system for Walmart using machine learning techniques tailored for retail demand prediction. The primary goal is to build regression models that accurately forecast weekly sales using historical data, promotional effects, and economic indicators such as CPI and unemployment. The project walks through the entire ML pipeline â€” from data cleaning and exploration to modeling and evaluation â€” ensuring actionable insights and forecast accuracy for business decision-making.

## ðŸ“Œ Project Overview

As one of the top retailers in the U.S., Walmart experiences major fluctuations in sales due to seasonal events and economic factors. Predicting sales precisely is crucial to avoid stock-outs and meet customer demand. This project tackles that challenge by leveraging advanced machine learning models to predict sales for 45 Walmart stores across different regions.

Promotional markdowns around major holidays like Super Bowl, Labour Day, Thanksgiving, and Christmas significantly impact sales patterns. These high-impact weeks are weighted five times more during evaluation. This project addresses the added complexity of modeling these effects despite incomplete historical markdown data.

## ðŸ“‚ Dataset Highlights

The dataset spans from **2010-02-05 to 2012-11-01**, combining data from three core files: `stores`, `features`, and `train`.

Key columns include:

- **Store** â€“ Store ID
- **Date** â€“ Weekly data timestamp
- **Weekly_Sales** â€“ Actual sales figure
- **IsHoliday** â€“ 1 = Holiday week, 0 = Non-holiday
- **Temperature** â€“ Weather conditions
- **Fuel_Price** â€“ Regional fuel cost
- **CPI** â€“ Consumer Price Index
- **Unemployment** â€“ Local unemployment rate

## ðŸ§  Project Pipeline

A structured machine learning workflow was adopted:

1. âœ… **Library Imports** â€“ Essential Python libraries (pandas, sklearn, seaborn, etc.)
2. âœ… **Dataset Integration** â€“ Merging, inspecting, and unifying all three core files
3. âœ… **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)** â€“ Uncovering trends, missing values, and sales distributions
4. âœ… **Preprocessing** â€“ Handling nulls, encoding, and feature engineering
5. âœ… **Feature Selection** â€“ Identifying variables most influential for sales prediction
6. âœ… **Modeling & Evaluation** â€“ Building regression models, tuning hyperparameters, and comparing metrics like RMSE
7. âœ… **Insights & Conclusion** â€“ Understanding what drives sales, the impact of holidays, and how predictions compare to benchmarks like the S&P 500

> ðŸŽ¯ **Outcome:** A predictive pipeline capable of estimating weekly sales performance, optimizing inventory decisions, and helping retailers align with holiday-driven demand spikes.
